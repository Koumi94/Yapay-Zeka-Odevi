# This project is the for my Intelligent Artificiel course

Using covid_vaccine data I will try to find out the efficacite of the vaccin with KNN,LogisticRegression and Random forest and the same time this work is for identifing the best location covid vaccination centers in a given town or region based on the optimization methodology of the paper. The optimization relies on the proximity of the vaccination sites to the local village centers along with the number of COVID cases and population densities within each barangay.
